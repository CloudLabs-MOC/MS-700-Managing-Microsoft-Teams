# **Lab 03: Plan and configure network settings for Microsoft Teams**

# **Student lab answer key**

## **Use the new Microsoft 365 admin center**

Throughout the lab exercises for this course, if you navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center and are prompted with a window asking if you want to try the new Microsoft 365 admin center, always select the **Try it now** button.  
‎‎  
‎**‎IMPORTANT**: The instructions that are provided in the lab exercise for this course are based on the new Microsoft 365 admin center UI and not the classic UI.

## **Lab Scenario**

In the labs of this course, you will assume the role of Joni Sherman, a Teams Administrator for Contoso Ltd. Your organization is planning to deploy Microsoft Teams. However, there are concerns about the current network infrastructure to meet the requirements for Microsoft Teams services. Therefore, you need to analyze the current network infrastructure and perform bandwidth calculations. Based on your estimation, you can provide recommendations to the networking team. 

## **Objectives**

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Calculate the network bandwidth capacity for a Teams deployment

- Work with the Microsoft 365 network connectivity test tool on a client

## **Lab Setup**

- **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes.

## **Instructions**

### **Exercise 1: Calculate networking capabilities**

Microsoft Teams provides users with chat, audio, video, and content sharing experience in different network conditions. It includes variable codecs, where media can be negotiated in limited bandwidth environments. However, as a Teams admin, you will need to carefully plan your network bandwidth, because there are other Office 365 services and third-party apps that also need a reliable network connection. Therefore, Teams admins must-have tools that could help to estimate the bandwidth consumption according to specific business requirements and existing network infrastructure and provide the best experience to business users.

#### Task 1 - Calculate network bandwidth capacity

In this exercise, you will calculate the network requirements for Microsoft teams, depending on your expected Teams usage business requirements. You must ensure enough bandwidth based on your organization network connectivity that is described in the following table:

| **Location**| **Total number of employees**| **WAN link capacity / audio/video queue size (Mbps)**| **Office 365 connection**| **Internet connection** |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| New York HQ| 1000| 1000/300/500| ExpressRoute| Local Internet 1000 Mbps |
| Los Angeles Office| 250| 500/100/200| Remote connection through HQ| Remote Internet through HQ |
| Houston Office| 150| 400/50/100| Remote connection through HQ| Remote Internet through HQ |


Next, you will analyze your current bandwidth usage and test your network quality and connection to Microsoft Teams. You will also need to troubleshoot potential voice quality issues.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

19. On the report page, select the **Switch to chart view** at the upper-right hand corner to display report results in different views.

Once you generate the report, you’ll see the recommendation of your bandwidth requirements. The allowed bandwidth shows how much of your overall traffic is reserved for real-time communications. Thirty percent is the recommended threshold. By changing this value and selecting **Run report**, you can see the different impacts on the bandwidth for your network. Any areas that need more bandwidth will be highlighted in red. Work with your instructor to modify the parameters in the Network Planner and verify different results based on the input data.

In this lab, you have used Network Planner to estimate the Microsoft Teams impact on the bandwidth in your network infrastructure.
